It has been realized over the past decade that the black hole(BH) at the centre of a galaxy bulge is no mere ornament but may play a major role in galaxy evolution. The process by which this occurs is known as AGN(Active Galactic Nucleus) feedback and it takes place through an interaction between the energy and radiation generated by accretion onto the massive BH and the gas in the host galaxy. The possibility arises where the intense flux of photons and particles produced by the AGN sweeps the galaxy bulge clean of interstellar gas, terminates star formation, and through lack of fuel for acrretion, terminates the AGN. However, the ratio of the size of the BH to host galaxy is tiny and similar to coin in comparison to the Earth. In contrary to this comparison, AGN have a potent effect on galaxy formation and evolution even the large-scale structure. For example, the energy released to build a BH with mass $M_{BH}=10^{8} \mathbf{M}_{\odot}$ would correspond to $E_{BH} \approx 0.1M_{BH}c^{2}$. This total accretion energy is two-to-three order of magnitude higher than the binding energy of the galaxy bulge in which this BH is reside, and is comparable to, even higher than, the thermal energy of the gas in the dark matter halo in which this galaxy resides. So the study on AGN feedback is extremely important for galaxy even cosmology.

Theoretical models of galaxy formation and evolution have found it necessary to implement AGN feedback processes, during which AGN activity injects energy into the gas in the larger scale environment in order to produce the observational evidence. There are two sorts of AGN feedback divided according to mechanism. The first one is radio mode feedback also known as maintenance mode or kinetic mode, this mode of feedback is  thought to be most efficient in the most massive halos, at late times and during periods of low BH accretion rates. The objects that are responsible for this type of feedback are likely to be low-excitation radio AGN which has low accretion rate and is always companied by radio lobes. This method of feedback is mainly use to explain the cut-off at the bright of the galaxy luminosity function in cluster environment. In contrast, a more catastrophic form of interaction between AGN and their host galaxies is proposed during periods of rapid accretion known as quasar mode or radiative mode. The objects are predicted to be responsible for this type of feedback are the radiatively-efficient AGN which has large accretion rate. Theoretical models that invoke this form of feedback typically require $\approx 0.005-0.15$ of the accretion energy to couple to the cold gas within the host galaxy and to expel this gas through outflows which ultimately results in the shut-down of future BH growth or star formation. In addition, analytical models have used the idea of galaxy-scale outflows initially launched by AGN, to explain $M_{BH}-M_{bulge}$ relationship. While this form of feedback has been predicted to be effective at producing high mass outflow rates and quench star formation. In addition to the potential affects of AGN feedback described above, AGN-driven outflows may be required to blow the gas in their host galaxy out to explain the chemical enrichment of intercluster medium(ICM) and circumgalactic medium(CGM). It has also been prompted that, in some cases, these outflows could induce positive feedback which trigger star formation by inducing pressure in cold gas reservoirs. So the theory of galaxy formation and evolution strongly depends on AGN feedback models. However, there are still many problems to be solved, it is not well established how the accretion energy couples to the gas to drive outflows and the impact of outflow on a much larger physical scale. Observations are required to constrain the details of how, when and where these processes actually occur.

%AGN feedback has lots of profound effects on galaxy evolution. 
%In the local universe, most galaxies are found massive cluster with 
%a giant elliptical galaxy locating at center. The current hierarchical 
%structure formation model predicts that these central galaxies merge 
%with several nearby satellite galaxies to build up their stellar mass. 
%This violent merging process is thought to take place in the highest 
%density peaks in the early Universe, the so-called protoclusters. 
%There are several decades year efforts on searching for these structures 
%at high-redshift and some methods have been proposed. However it is still 
%under debates that on which systems represent the nurseries of present-day 
%massive clusters.

%Previous work searching for protocluster base on high-redshift radio galaxies(HzRGs). This method is supported by ly$\alpha$ emitters(LAEs) overdensities near them, and in some cases by overdensities in submillimeter observations. Being the host of active galactic nucleus(AGN) and characterized by intense radio emission, HzRGs are also known for their associated giant ly$\alpha$ nebulae on hundreds of kpc scales. However, \cite{cai2015mapping} proposed a new method, Coherently Strong intergalactic ly$\alpha$ Absorption systems(CoSLAs), to search for overdensities. With this approach he discovered an extremely massive overdensity BOSS1441 at z=2.32. Through narrow band observation with Large Binocular Telescope(LBT),\cite{cai2017discovery} found an enormous ly$\alpha$ nebulae(ELANe) projected distance of which is beyond 400kpc. This is also the largest ELANes ever discovered. In the cosmic hierarchical nature of structure formation, large-scale filaments are formed out of the merging of small-scale pieces. Simulations suggest that cosmic webs containing baryonic matter tend to align with underlying large-scale structures of dark matter. So, the discovery of such large scale nebulae is a strong evidence of cosmic large-scale structure and the hierarchical model of galaxies formation.
%
%Futhermore, the long-slit observations indicate the ELANe of MAMMOTH-1 has a drastically different kinematics compared to previously discovered ELANes. It is the first radio-quiet nebulae that is associated with strongly extended HeII CIV OIII and H$\alpha$ emission. The emission lines can be fit by two major components about 1000km/s. This result suggests there is strong feedback powered by central AGN. AGN are fascinating objects, the huge amounts of energy released by the active super massive black hole(SMBH) can have an impact on the life and evolution of their entire host galaxy. This process is called AGN feedback, which is a key ingredient in the theory model of galaxies evolution. AGN feedback is now included in many theoretical, numerical and semi-analytic models. The goal of the observation is to provide constraints to help a realistic implementation of feedback effects in simulations. several evidences show powerful outflow from AGN. \cite{sturm2011massive} used Herschel-PACS find high velocities above 1000 km/s and mass outflow rate $\dot{M} \approx 1200 M_{\odot} /yr$ in Ultra-Luminous Infared Galaxies(ULIRGs). There're also many reports of outflows from galaxies hosting AGN 1000 km/s outflows have been seen either side of an obscured quasar at low redshifts. Besides, strong outflows at high redshift are also observed. In most cases outflows are discovered by metal absorption lines such as OIII or CII. This method is popular to for outflows search because there's huge quantities of material in galaxies and we can estimate its peculiar velocity by spectra. A spectacular example is the 1300 km/s outflow in a quasar at $z \approx 6.4$ revealed by broad wings of CII emission line(\cite{cicone2015very}). The kinetic power in the outflow is $\dot{E} \approx 2 \times 10^{45} erg/s$.

%In this paper we present Keck Cosmic Web Imager(KCWI) blue sensitive Integral Field Spectrometer(IFS) observation of MAMMOTH-1 which is the denest region ever seen at $z \approx 2$. In section 2 we give details of IFU observations, In section 3 we present the results and model used to estimate outflow energy. Finally we discuss the ly$\alpha$ nebula and the possible mechanism to power the strong outflow, and give a brief summary in section 5. Throughout this paper, we assume a flat cosmological model with $\omega_{\Lambda}=0.7$,$\omega_{m}=0.3$ and $H_{0}=70 km/s/Mpc$. In this cosmology, 1"$ \approx 8.2$kpc at z=2.3.
