	Deep VLA observation(\cite{emonts2019cold}) discover CO(1-0) emission which trace the cold molecular gas (T$\approx$10-100 K) on the central source of MAMMOTH-1(we use the terminology in \cite{cai2017discovery} and call it source-B in following sections) and its companions with the D-configuration of VLA and centered on the frequency of 34.808 GHz($\nu_{rest}$=115.27 GHz). After 14 hrs exposure, the results shows extended peak radio flux which has ~ 5 kpc offset from the stellar body of source-B (~30 kpc beyond 3$\sigma$) and 3 faint radio sources in the same region. However, no continuum radio source was found near Source-B. We check the continuum image of \cite{emonts2019cold} and give an upper limit on its submillimeter emission, $f_{\nu}<0.01 mJy$ at $\lambda_{obs}=8500 \mu m$. But from the results of \cite{arrigoni2018qso}(Fig. 11), this upper limit still cannot rule out the the radio-loud case. But neither the VLA nor ALMA observations detected two distinct radio sources around Source-B, we conclude that Source-B is most likely radio-quiet source.
