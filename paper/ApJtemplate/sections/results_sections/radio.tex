	\cite{emonts2019cold} used sensitive low-surface-brightness observations of Very Large Array (VLA) to trace the cold molecular gas in the inner region of MAMMOTH-1 by detecting the CO (1-0) emission. They found four CO sources which are a few kpc away from the associated galaxies or groups. This result suggests that the core of the potential well of this Ly$\alpha$ nebula is marked by the cold gas rather than the obscured AGN. Since none of the continuum image (center on 35 GHz and 150 GHz) from VLA and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) shows significant detection, we use them to give an 3-$\sigma$ upper limit on its continuum emission in radio band, $\rm f_{35,up}=0.050$ mJy, $\rm f_{150,up}=0.066$ mJy. By combining these two upper limits with the optical and infrared data from \citet{arrigoni2018overdensity}, we fit the spectral energy distribution (SED) of BOSS1441 with M82 template from \cite{Silva_1998} in Fig.\ref{SED}. Gray lines represent the SEDs of "radio-excess" galaxies in \citet{harrison2014kiloparsec} and triangles represent the flux density at 1.4 GHz of these sources. The brown dashed line is the average of SEDs belonging to 1056 radio galaxies (RG) with redshifts in the range of $0.0028-1.7$ \citep{Toba_2019}. All of these SEDs have been normalized and shifted to $z=2.31$. M82 template fits extremely well with observed flux of source-B even including the two upper limits from ALMA and VLA, this evidence indicates that source-B is possibly a star burst galaxy. In addition to the departure of M82 template and the observed flux of source-B far from RG template in radio band, we conclude that source-B should be a radio-quiet quasar.

	 We calculate the ratio between the far-infrared ($\rm 8-1000 \ \mu m$) and radio emission ($\rm q_{IR}$) with the definition given by \cite{ivison2010far} to quantitatively define if source-B has significant radio emission, this ratio is usually used to identify if there is significant radio emission above that expected from their star-formation activity (radio emission results from AGN or other process). The formula is given by:
	\begin{equation}
		\rm q_{IR}=log[\frac{S_{IR}/3.75 \times 10^{12} W \ m^{-2}}{S_{1.4}/W \ m^{-2} Hz^{-1}}]
		\label{q_IR}
	\end{equation}
	where $\rm S_{IR}$ is the rest-frame flux in far-infrared range ($8-1000 \ \rm \mu m $) and $\rm S_{1.4}$ is the flux density at 1.4 GHz in rest frame. \citet{arrigoni2018overdensity} performed a follow-up observation for MAMMOTH-1 to constrain the SED with the available data and then derive some properties of source-B. The far-infrared luminosity is integrated from this SED $\rm L_{IR}=3.2 \times 10^{12}L_{\odot}$. Through setting the luminosity distance to be $\rm D_{L}=18773.8$ Mpc at redshift z=2.3, it is easy to calculate the far-infrared flux $\rm S_{IR}=2.9 \times 10^{-16}\ W \ cm^{-2}$.  Because the D-configuration of VLA doesn't cover $\rm \nu_{obs}=0.42$ GHz (1.4 GHz in rest frame), we adopt $\rm S_{1.4}$=0.01 mJy from M82 SED template. We note here that the constrain of continuum, $f_{150,up}$, is one-order-magnitude lower than that of M82 SED template, therefore the true flux density at $\rm \nu_{rest}=1.4$ GHz is possibly lower than 0.01 mJy. By adopting $\rm S_{1.4}=0.01 mJy$ the low limit of $\rm q_{IR}$ is equal to 1.9. \citet{ivison2010far} and \citet{del2013goods} define "radio excess" sources as those with $\rm q_{IR} \leqslant 1.8$, this calculation also supports that source-B has no significant radio emission.
