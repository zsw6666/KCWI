## Preliminary observation of feedback

1. David_2019_nature: 100kpc feedback wind in CGM:
   * **SDSS J211824.06+001729.4.** at z~0.4 observed by KCWI: 100kpc OII emission(3726A and 3729A) with mirror-symmetry mophology. 
   *  **OII emission**: Two apparent shells consist of two kinematical components powered by two star burst(inner:latest star burst(SB)(<7Myr) with large dispersion and velocity~1400km/s, outter: last SB(0.4 Gyr before), small dispersion and velocity~100km/s). Only blueshift component found.
   * **CO(2-1) emission**, molacular gas, both blueshifted and redshifted gas(-500~-1500km/s 500~1500km/s) with 20kpc.
   * **MgII resonant line(2796A 2803A)** both blue and red component(-500km/s~500km/s) with 20kpc.
2. Chaves_2019_AA: ly-alpha+CIV+HeII radio jet
   * **HLock01-LAB** at z~3.3 observed by Gran Telescope ly-alpha HeII, CIV emission and two companied continuum radio lobe.
